# Kaitai Struct: visualization GUI tool in Java

This is a Java-based GUI for data structure visualizations in binary
formats, based on [Kaitai Struct](http://kaitai.io) project. This vis
tool uses [Java's Swing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_%28Java%29)
for its GUI elements.

Its functionality is akin to similar projects:

* [kaitai_struct_visualizer](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_visualizer) in Ruby
* [WebIDE](https://ide.kaitai.io/) in TypeScript for web brosers
* [kaitai-struct-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fudgepops.kaitai-struct-vscode) in TypeScript for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

... but this Java version is significantly simpler and is no longer under
active development.

Kaitai Struct is a declarative language used to describe various
binary data structures, laid out in files or in memory: i.e. binary
file formats, network stream packet formats, etc.

The main idea is that a particular format is described in Kaitai
Struct language (`.ksy` files) only once and then can be compiled with
this compiler into source files in one of the supported programming
languages. These modules will include the generated code for a parser
that can read described data structure from a file / stream and give
access to it in a nice, easy-to-comprehend API.

## Build
Install java, maven and, if on windows, git-bash
